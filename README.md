# Natural Language Scripts

My natural language scripts which are for LLM agents

Just found that if you rich enough (or have free APIs), you don't need to maintain complex setup scripts for all different OS, machine, devices etc.
Just let LLM do it for you. And save your energy to where worth to go to.

## Development Environment

### Setup Coding Agents

> You might need to get one manually 😂 in the first place.

```txt
Please install coding agents using the following guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daviddwlee84/nl-scripts/refs/heads/main/dev-bootstrap/coding-agents.md
```

> - `opencode run [message..]     run opencode with a message` (not recommend for now, since we might have some interactive sections)
> - Tested that `opencode` will interactively ask which CLI tools you would like to install

### Setup UNIX environment

```txt
Please help me setup environment using the following guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daviddwlee84/nl-scripts/refs/heads/main/dev-bootstrap/unix-environments.md
Ask user to install in user space (prefered) or system space. If require any sudo permission, show the commands at the end so user can execute themselves.
If any tool user already install then skip them.
```

NOTE: currently focus on Unix (macOS, Ubuntu) system
